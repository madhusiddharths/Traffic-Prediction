# Traffic-Prediction

Our model predicts the traffic for upcoming days and maps the shortest parth between two places based on the new predictions. Traditional time series models dont fit will with small intervals (5 min) and also cannot handle missing data. Hence, an innovative approach to use classical ml model (random forest regressor) to fit the time series data and improve the accuracy (r2 - 0.87).
